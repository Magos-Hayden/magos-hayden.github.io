					<h3>Why does this website exist?</h3>
					<p><strong>Superficial explanation:</strong> Because it can!</p>
					<p><strong>Further elaboration:</strong> The main purpose for this website is to be my personal calling card for others to contact me online for work, play, and everything between. Not only that, but it is also designed to be accessable to those still using web browsers on Windows XP or older.</p>
					<p>While I mainly been on the sidelines looking onwards onto the state of the Internet, solely as an observer with my presence, I can partake with some of the activity of interaction with my own online presence. Still, this is merely a first step for my social participation online beyond spectation!</p>
					<h3>Who's the man behind the curtain?</h3>
					<p>Just an enthusiast of obsolete technology, 90s-2000s Internet web design, a retro video gamer, and a creator of realities unknown applied as fiction. This description only shows a fraction of who I am, who I was, and who I can become!</p>
